# BigFlames

BigFlames is an example SproutCore application that shows you how to use [FireCore](https://github.com/profoundry-us/FireCore/).

Check the FireCore [README](https://github.com/profoundry-us/FireCore/) for more information!

## Testing

Clone this project, start the sproutcore server, and visit [http://localhost:4020/big_flames](http://localhost:4020/big_flames)
to get started. You can then play around in the console and create, update and destroy records (BigFlames.Flame).
